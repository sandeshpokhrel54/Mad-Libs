                    "THE LETTER TO HER PARENTS"

     Dear name1 and name2;
 
       Will you let me verb1 your daughter? Ever since I have laid my thing1 on her, I have fallen madly in noun1 with her. I wish that she will be the thing2 of my  noun2 and that someday we will verb2                happily ever after. I have a noun3 everyone loves and craves for.I promise to verb3 your daughter with kindness and respect.

        Sincerely,
              name4
