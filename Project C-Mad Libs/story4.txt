            The Madness Of Self Intepretation

To give you an example of selective listening, let me share 
with you a story I heard about a medical doctor who was 
invited as a guest speaker to address a group of alcoholics. 
He wanted to make a demonstration that would be powerful 
enough to make people realize that alcohol was injurious to 
their health. He had two containers, one with pure distilled 
water and one with pure alcohol. He put an earthworm into 
the distilled water and it swam beautifully and came up to 
the top. He put another earthworm into the alcohol and it 
disintegrated in front of everyone's eyes. He wanted to 
prove that this was what alcohol did to the insides of our 
body. He asked the group what the moral of the story was 
and one person from behind said, "If you drink alcohol you 
won't have worms in your stomach." Was that the 
message? Of course not. That was self intepretation--we 
hear what we want to hear and not what is being said. 
Many of our blessings are hidden treasures--count your 
blessings and not your troubles.
