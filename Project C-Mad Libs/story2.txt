                "THE MAGIC STORY"

"Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe,
 I was just outside Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount
 Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, 
and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all 
around. It was dead silent.Gorgeous
 And across the river I saw a beautiful woman, 
bathing herself. but she was crying.
I stared, watching, struck by her beauty. 
And also by how her presence; the delicate curve of her back,
 the dark sweep of her hair, the graceful length of her limbs, 
even her tear, added to the majesty of my surroundings. 
I felt my own tears burning behind my eyes, not in sympathy,
 but in appreciation of such a perfect moment.
