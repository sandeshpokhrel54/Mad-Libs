Smelly CAT, smelly CAT
What are they FEEDING you?
Smelly CAT, smelly CAT
It`s not your FAULT.

They won`t TAKE you to the VET.
You`re obviously not their FAVOURITE PET.
You may not be a BED of ROSES,
And you`re no FRIEND to those  NOSES.

Smelly CAT, smelly CAT
What are they FEEDING you?
Smelly CAT, smelly CAT
It`s not your FAULT.
